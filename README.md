# starikcetin.Tracking2D #

This was an attempt to replace Unity's built-in 2D physics engine wtih only the features I wanted.

It kind of did what I wanted it to: it was predictable, constant, and stable. But performance-wise it wasn't good enough.

Depends on [starikcetin.UnityCommon](https://github.com/starikcetin/starikcetin.UnityCommon)
