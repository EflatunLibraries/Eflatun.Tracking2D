# Eflatun.Tracking2D #

This was an attempt to replace Unity's built-in 2D physics engine wtih only the features I wanted.

**As of right now, this code is not throughly tested and doesn't have a shiny performance.**

I *may* convert this library to use Unity ECS once it becomes production-ready, but it is not certain.
